# Running-Algos of computer vision( AR,3D included)
*<i><ins>mainly for AR,3D based environment</ins></i><br/>
<b><i>Inspired by work named "Soccer on your tabletop"</i></b><br/>

<b>* This repo includes debugging of their entire code and reproducing the parts that are missing as per their pipeline-><br/>
  
<b>* This work and it's future proceedings does include the replacement of their core algorithms for segmentation like: <ins>Detectron based segmentation via SparseInst</ins>, <ins>Pixellib's C++ version via python implementation</ins><br/>

Here the algorithms working uploaded are like ideal algorithms that developer can use to create some projects on computer vision the working of which if altered with some errors then can be easily traced on stackoverflow kind of helping community sites.<br/>
